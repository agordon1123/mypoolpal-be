# MY POOL PAL BACK-END

## TECH
This back-end was built using Node.js and Express.js. This RESTful API will handle authentication and provide users with a way to store multiple pools, record chemical readings for a pool service, see a list of previous readings, and receive recommendations of chemical adjustments to be made (this will be calculated on the front-end).

Future releases will include a troubleshooting tree to help pool owners diagnose common issues with their pool without having to contact a service company, helping customers save money. We would also like to link recommendations to local pool companies if the troubleshooting tree determines a repair is needed.
